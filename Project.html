<h2><u>BASIC</u></h2>

<ul>
<li>BASIC was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College</li>    
<li>BASIC became widely used on microcomputers in the mid 70s to 80s</li> 
<li>Having an easy to learn language such as BASIC allowed a variety of people to develop their own softeare on computers they could afford</li>   
<li>The language was developed for students and people that didn't specialize in science and mathematics to use computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>Java</u></h2>
<a href="https://programmingbydoing.com/"><img class="img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Java_logo.png" alt="Picture of Java"></a>
<ul>
<li>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is conccurrent, class-based, and object oriented</li>    
<li>It is intended to let application developers "write once, run everywhere"</li>
<li>Java apps are designed to work on any computer that contains a Java virtual machine regardless of the type of computer and how it is constructed</li>
<li>Javais one of the most popular programming languages currently in use, especially for client-server web applications</li>
<li>Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995, you can clearly see that the languages syntax is primarily derived from C and C++</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>Python</u></h2>
<a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/"><img class="img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/260px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="Picture of Python"></a>
<ul>
<li>Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language</li>    
<li>The design is emphasizes code readability and it's syntax allows you to do more, while writing less lines than in C++ or Java</li>
<li>Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable packages so that Python-based software can be used on enviroments without a Python interpreter</li>
<li>Python was created in the late 80s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, it was not implemented until December 1989</li>   
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>Ruby</u></h2>    
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"><img class="img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Ruby_logo.svg/100px-Ruby_logo.svg.png" alt="Picture of Ruby"></a>
<ul>
<li>Ruby is a dynamic, reflected, object-oriented, and genera-purpose programming language</li>
<li>Ruby was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto</li>
<li>Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp</li>
<li>The syntax of Ruby shows strong similarities to Perl and Python</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>C++</u></h2>
<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/"><img class="img-rounded" src="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/images/cpp-mini-logo.jpg" alt="Picture of C++"></a>
<ul>
<li>C++ is a general-purpose programming language which has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features</li>    
<li>C++ has been found useful in many different contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and preformance-critical applications</li>
<li>C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms provided by various organizations</li>  
<li>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979, as an extension of the C language, as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided feature for program orginization</li>
<li>C++ influenced many well known programming languages, such as Perl, Java, Lua, Python, and PHP</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"><img class="img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/HTML.svg/2000px-HTML.svg.png" alt="Picture of HTML" length=256 width=193></a>
<ul>
<li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages</li>
<li>Commonly used with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create a majority of all websites</li>
<li>HTML describes the structure of a website semantically while CSS includes cues for the presentation and appearance of the document</li>
<li>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting strucural semantics for text such as heading, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items</li>
<li>In 1980 physicist Tim Berners-Lee proposed and prototyped  a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents, in 1989 Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Inernet-based hypertext system later known as HTML</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Bash</u></h2>
<a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><img class="img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Bash_screenshot.png/300px-Bash_screenshot.png" alt="Picture of Bash"></a>
<ul>
<li>Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell</li>    
<li>First released in 1989, Bash has been distributed widely as it as a default shell on the major Linux distributions and OS X</li>
<li>Bash is a command processor which runs in a text window, where users type commands that cause actions, Bash can read commands from a file, browse directories and many other things</li>
<li>The keywords, syntax, and other basic features of the language were all copied from sh</li>
